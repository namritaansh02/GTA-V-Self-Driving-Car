# Summer-of-Development
Set of basic software development and machine learning projects done to enhance my programming skills over the summer

# Summary of Work
• Established an end-to-end driving pipeline in GTA V, employing lanenet and OpenCV with response rate of 5Hz
• Leveraged OOP to define spherical object collision mechanics, explored non-spherical object collision algorithms
• Integrated YOLOv3 human detection module in CS:GO, yielding 30% mean performance boost over novice player
